üßë‚Äçüíª Hi, I'm Cyb3rm0nk and, 

This repository serves as a hub for my ongoing cybersecurity projects, research, and learning journey. As a **CCNA certified** professional working as a **Jr. Network and System Administrator**, I bring a strong foundation in network operations and system management to my cybersecurity pursuits. I'm deeply interested in **network security** and **ethical hacking**, and I'll be using this space to document my progress, share code, and explore various tools and techniques.

You can also follow my cybersecurity insights and articles on my [Medium](https://cyb3rm0nk.medium.com/).

## What You'll Find Here

* **Network Security:** Projects related to securing networks, leveraging my **CCNA knowledge** for firewall configurations, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) analysis, secure network design principles, and VPN implementations.
* **Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing:** Scripts and methodologies used for ethical hacking exercises, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests. This will cover various phases like reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation, often with a focus on **network infrastructure vulnerabilities**. I regularly practice on **Hack The Box labs** and **TryHackMe offensive labs** to sharpen my skills.
* **System Administration & Security:** Projects that bridge my system administration experience with security, including secure server hardening, patch management automation, and access control implementations.
* **Security Tools & Scripts:** A collection of custom scripts and configurations for popular cybersecurity tools (e.g., Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit) and utilities relevant to network and system administration.
* **Learning Resources:** Curated lists of articles, courses, and documentation that I've found valuable in my cybersecurity studies.
